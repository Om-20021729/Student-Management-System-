# Student-Management-System-
The Student Management System is a simple Python application that helps manage student records using basic file handling and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows users to add, view, update, and delete student information such as roll number, name, age, and course. The system stores the records in a text file (students.txt) for persistence.
